        <h3>Dry Beans Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dry Beans:</strong> The star of the show, these beans are hearty and flavorful. This recipe uses dry beans as it helps create a richer flavor.<br> By seasoning the beans as they cook this helped create a more authentic Brazilian recipe as well.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh Onion:</strong> Adds a sweet, aromatic base. I always use fresh onions for that authentic taste.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh Garlic:</strong> Essential for that depth of flavor; minced garlic infuses the beans beautifully.</li>
            <li><strong>Bay Leaf:</strong> A must for the traditional Brazilian touch. They add a subtle, herbal aroma.</li>
            <li><strong>Paprika:</strong> I prefer smoked paprika for its rich, smoky undertone.</li>
            <li><strong>Cumin:</strong> Brings a warm, earthy spice that's unmistakable in Brazilian cooking.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt and black pepper:</strong> Just a pinch to enhance all the flavors.</li>
            <li><strong>Olive Oil:</strong> I love using olive oil for its health benefits and smooth flavor.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Brazilian Rice Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Long Grain White Rice:</strong> The foundation of our dish, providing a fluffy and light texture.</li>
            <li><strong>Olive Oil:</strong> For sautéing the rice, giving it a wonderful aroma and a hint of richness.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh Onion:</strong> Finely chopped, it adds a subtle sweetness.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh Garlic:</strong> Minced, for that essential punch of flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt:</strong> To bring out the natural flavors of the rice.</li>
            <li><strong>Water:</strong> The key to cooking the rice to perfection.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step-by-Step Instructions: Stove Pot and Instant Pot</h3>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Start by Soaking Your Beans:</strong> This is crucial for reducing the cooking time. I usually soak mine overnight, but if you're pressed for time, 3 hours should suffice.</li>
            <li><strong>Drain and Cook:</strong> After soaking, drain and rinse the beans. Transfer them to a large pot and add enough water to cover them by 2 inches. Toss in 3 bay leaves, cover, and cook over medium-high heat until they are slightly soft, about 60 minutes.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Preparing the Flavor Base:</strong> In a separate pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion, minced garlic, and spices and sauté until the onions are translucent.<br>
                About 3 minutes. This step is where the magic happens – slow cooking the onions and garlic allows their flavors to fully develop and infuse the oil.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Mash in Some Beans: </strong>Scoop out about a third of the cooked beans (leave the broth in the pot) and add them to the onion-garlic mixture. Gently smash them with your spoon.<br>
                This technique thickens the beans and creates a creamy texture, which is a hallmark of Brazilian-style beans.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Final Simmer:</strong> Combine the two pots. Add the mashed beans mixture back into the pot (or instant pot) with the remaining beans and their liquid.<br>
                Stir well and let it simmer for about 30 minutes. The smashed beans will work their magic, thickening the broth and melding the flavors together.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step-by-Step: How to Cook Traditional Brazilian Rice</h3>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Rinse the Rice:</strong> Start by thoroughly rinsing the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This step is crucial for removing excess starch, which helps in achieving that classic Brazilian rice texture - fluffy and non-sticky.</li>
            <li><strong>Sautee the Rice:</strong> Next add the rinsed rice and stir it for a couple of minutes. This technique, typical in Brazilian cooking, coats the grains with oil and aromatics, enhancing the flavor and texture of the final dish.</li>
            <li><strong>Boil and Simmer:</strong> Add water and salt to the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer. Cook until the water is absorbed and the rice is tender. Remember, the key to perfect rice is not to stir it too much while it's cooking.</li>
            <li><strong>Rest and Fluff:</strong> Once the rice is cooked, turn off the heat and let it sit covered for a few minutes. This allows the rice to steam and become perfectly fluffy. Fluff the rice with a fork before serving.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Now it's serving time! I hope you enjoy this dish that's deeply rooted into the Brazilian cuisine and culture!</h3>
