            <li><strong>1/2 pint of coconut milk</strong></li>
            <li><strong>3 1/2 oz of coconut, freshly grated or desiccated</strong></li>
            <li><strong>6 tbsp of sugar</strong></li>
            <li><strong>1/2 tsp vanilla paste</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Prune Sauce Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>7 1/16 oz of pitted prunes, chopped</strong></li>
            <li><strong>4 1/16 fl oz of water</strong></li>
            <li><strong>1 2/3 fl oz of red wine, (optional)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>sugar, to taste (I used 2 tbsp)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>1 cinnamon stick</strong></li>
            <li><strong>2 cloves</strong></li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Make the custard the day before serving. Pour 240g of the milk in a bowl and sift in the cornflour. Stir with a spoon until the cornflour has dissolved and set aside.</li>
            <li>Combine the cream, sugar, vanilla paste, coconut milk, grated coconut and the remaining milk in a medium saucepan and place over a medium heat.
                Bring to the boil, stirring all the time to prevent the mixture from sticking to the bottom of the pan.</li>
            <li>Once boiling, gradually add the cornflour and milk mixture and continue to stir until the mixture has thickened over a low heat. Remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>Rinse a bundt mould with water (to prevent the custard sticking), then pour the custard into the mould. Cover with cling film, allow to cool, then refrigerate overnight.</li>
            <li>To make the prune sauce, heat all of the ingredients (except the whole prunes) in a medium pan and simmer for 10–15 minutes, or until the prunes have softened and formed a homogeneous syrup.
                Add the whole prunes and cook for a further 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let the syrup cool completely before turning the custard out onto a serving plate and drizzling over the prune syrup. Decorate the top of the pudding with a few of the whole prunes.</li>
        </ol>
